Subject: Help recruiting Javascript devs

We really want to poach Squysh's JS devs to improve our frontend.
The recruiting team is a little worried that the devs won't want
to work with us unless we already have some working Javascript.

Can you update the empty main.js file so it does the things listed below?

Thanks again!

# To Do
1. Open main.js in your text editor. It can also be helpful to open js-demo.html as well so you have an easy way to reference the HTML on the page. You can even bring up the files side-by-side in one window in VS Code Text by draging a tab to the left or right of your editor to create a panel. In addition, there is a panel icon in the top right of VS Code that will open your current file in a new column, and many keyboard shortcuts as well. Further layouts can be found under View > Editor Layout.

2. When someone clicks the button with the class “color-changer”, all elements with the class “color-change” should turn red (you can do this by adding the class “red” to them).

3. When someone submits the form, prevent its default behavior (it should not redirect to a new page). Instead, validate the input in the text input with ID “number-input”. If it is not a number or greater than or equal to 10, change the text of the element with ID “formFeedback” to say ‘Please enter a smaller number’. Otherwise, change the text of that element to say “You are good to go!.”
